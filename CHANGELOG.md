### Changed
- Updated README to include drone-related UI components and their adaptability to other contexts.

### Fixed
- N/A

## [v0.2.1]

### Fixed
- Prevented the `vue-builder` container from exiting immediately after build by appending `tail -f /dev/null` to the entrypoint. (#1)
- Fixed `cesium:preinstall` script failure when `node_modules` was not present, ensuring robust dependency setup during container build. (#2)
- Added `.pnpm-store` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental version control tracking of local package cache. (#3)
- Solved startup blocking issue in `vue-builder` when `node_modules` directory already existed by forcing `CI=true` during `pnpm install`. (#4)
